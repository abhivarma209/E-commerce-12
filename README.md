# E-Commerce Website

LAMA is a sample application demonstrating an E-commerce website using the MERN stack. The application loads products into a MongoDB database and displays them. Users can log in or sign up, search and add products to their cart, order products, and make an online payment. Admin can add the products that appear on the website.
